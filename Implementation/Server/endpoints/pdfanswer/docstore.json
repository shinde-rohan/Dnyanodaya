Here are some key aspects and concepts related to  \ndatabase management systems:   \n  \nDefinition:   \n  \nA DBMS is a software application that interacts with the user, applications, and the database itself to  \ncapture and analyze data.   \nPurpose:   \n  \nThe primary purpose of a DBMS is to provide a structured and organized method for storing and  \nmanaging data, ensuring data integrity, and facilitating efficient data retrieval and manipulation.   \nComponents:   \n  \nData:   \nRepresents the information stored in the database.   \nDatabase:   \nA structured collection of data organized and stored for easy access and retrieval.   \nDBMS Software:   \nThe software that facilitates the creation, maintenance, and use of the database.   \nKey Features:   \n  \nData Definition Language (DDL):   \nAllows defining and managing the structure of the database, such as creating tables, defining  \nrelationships, and setting constraints.   \nData Manipulation Language (DML):   \nEnables users to interact with and manipulate the data, including inserting, updating, and deleting  \nrecords.   \nData Query Language (DQL):   \nAllows users to retrieve specific information from the database using queries.   \nData Integrity:   \nEnsures the accuracy and consistency of data through the use of constraints and validation rules.   \nConcurrency Control:","metadata":{"source":"./uploads/samplePDF.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.7","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Author":"Gaurav Thakur","Creator":"Microsoft® Word 2019","Producer":"Microsoft® Word 2019","CreationDate":"D:20240213004016+05'30'","ModDate":"D:20240213004016+05'30'"},"metadata":{"_metadata":{"pdf:producer":"Microsoft® Word 2019","dc:creator":"Gaurav Thakur","xmp:creatortool":"Microsoft® Word 2019","xmp:createdate":"2024-02-13T00:40:16+05:30","xmp:modifydate":"2024-02-13T00:40:16+05:30","xmpmm:documentid":"uuid:168BDE94-A90A-41E0-BDD9-A208F94C12FA","xmpmm:instanceid":"uuid:168BDE94-A90A-41E0-BDD9-A208F94C12FA"}},"totalPages":2},"loc":{"pageNumber":1,"lines":{"from":1,"to":33}}}}],["2c916e23-8ec5-44ec-a56e-9e9aa9e2eb19",{"pageContent":"Manages simultaneous access to the database to prevent conflicts and maintain data consistency.","metadata":{"source":"./uploads/samplePDF.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.7","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Author":"Gaurav Thakur","Creator":"Microsoft® Word 2019","Producer":"Microsoft® Word 2019","CreationDate":"D:20240213004016+05'30'","ModDate":"D:20240213004016+05'30'"},"metadata":{"_metadata":{"pdf:producer":"Microsoft® Word 2019","dc:creator":"Gaurav Thakur","xmp:creatortool":"Microsoft® Word 2019","xmp:createdate":"2024-02-13T00:40:16+05:30","xmp:modifydate":"2024-02-13T00:40:16+05:30","xmpmm:documentid":"uuid:168BDE94-A90A-41E0-BDD9-A208F94C12FA","xmpmm:instanceid":"uuid:168BDE94-A90A-41E0-BDD9-A208F94C12FA"}},"totalPages":2},"loc":{"pageNumber":2,"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}]],{"0":"e24f5e14-89ea-4090-b96c-8ce32bc2d882","1":"2c916e23-8ec5-44ec-a56e-9e9aa9e2eb19"}]
